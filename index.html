    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate Mechatronic engineering student with extensive experience in CAD and
            mechanical fabrication. Notable projects include the designing and manufacturing of chemically
            powered vehicles (ChemECar and Solar Sunray Car). Through these projects I have gained
            proficiency in SolidWorks, Finite Element Analysis, C programming as well as 3D manufacturing and
            fabrication. I am also honoured to have been awarded the Long Tan ADF future innovator award for
            my projects and excellence in STEM. I combine a deep theoretical understanding of mechanical and
            electrical systems with hands-on experience in 3D printing as seen in my portfolio of projects.

            <h3>ChemECar</h3>
            <p>
                The ChemECar project involved developing a model vehicle powered exclusively by chemical reactions. As a Mechanical Design Engineer,
                I utilized SolidWorks to model and assemble critical components, ensuring seamless integration with subsystems designed by cross functional teams. 
                This role required high precision modeling and a 'Design for Manufacture' approach, as parts were 3D printed and assembled for international 
                competition in China. The project sharpened my ability to manage complex technical interfaces and prioritize deliverables within a high-stakes, 
                collaborative environment.

            <h3>Gridfinity System</h3>
            <p>
                The Gridfinity system, designed by Zach Freedman, is a modular, 3D-printable storage solution for workspace organization. 
                I utilized this project to deepen my expertise in CAD and additive manufacturing while streamlining my own workspace.
                After printing standard 42 mm x 42 mm baseplates on my personal printer, I designed custom component housings in Fusion 360.
                This required precise modeling within strict dimensional constraints to ensure a "perfect fit" for various tools. 
                By optimizing these designs for manufacture (DfM), I successfully reduced print time, filament consumption, and overall cost without 
                compromising quality.

            <h3>Self-Hosted Website</h3>
            <p>
                This website is self-hosted on my private server. As anyone familiar with self-hosting knows, exposing a home network to the open internet
                carries significant risks from bots and malicious actors. To mitigate this, I routed all traffic through Cloudflare Tunnels,
                effectively masking my home IP and securing the connection. Built using HTML and CSS, the site’s full source code is available on my GitHub 
                (found in the contacts section). This project was a deep dive into the intricacies of networking and SSH, reinforcing the importance of 
                a "security-first" mindset when building public-facing infrastructure.

            <h3>Solar Sunray</h3>
            <p>
                For this university design project, I collaborated with a team to develop a solar-powered vehicle utilizing a hybrid array of four panels 
                (two small, two large). To maintain operational efficiency across diverse environmental conditions—ranging from direct sunlight to heavy cloud 
                cover—we engineered an adaptive electrical system. By implementing an eight-switch configuration, we enabled real-time toggling between series and 
                parallel circuits, allowing us to optimize voltage and current based on available irradiance. Although we developed a custom gear-switching system, 
                time constraints shifted our focus toward perfecting the electrical optimization. This experience was pivotal in learning how to integrate diverse 
                technical perspectives within a collaborative team environment.
