    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate Mechatronic engineering student with extensive experience in CAD and
            mechanical fabrication. Notable projects include the designing and manufacturing of chemically
            powered vehicles (ChemECar and Solar Sunray Car). Through these projects I have gained
            proficiency in SolidWorks, Finite Element Analysis, C programming as well as 3D manufacturing and
            fabrication. I am also honoured to have been awarded the Long Tan ADF future innovator award for
            my projects and excellency in STEM. I combine a deep theoretical understanding of mechanical and
            electrical systems with hands-on experience in 3D printing as seen in my portfolio of projects.

            <h3>ChemECar</h3>
            <p>
                ChemECar is a fully functioning model car that is purely powered by chemical reactions. As part of the team
                I was a mechanical design Engineer and tasked to construct CAD models of key components of the car on Solidworks 
                and then assemble these components using the assembly features. When designing these components we had to consider how 
                they would interact with other components of the vehicle that were being designed by other teams. We would then 3D print these components and then
                finaly assemble them in time for the competion held in China. This project taught me how to work in a group environment efficiently and to prioritise 
                delivery time to ensure the project is delivered on time.

            <h3>Gridfinity System</h3>
            <p>
                The Gridfinity system is a highly customisable printable modular storage system designed by Zach Freedman to organise 
                workspaces. I took this opportunity as a learning experience for fabriacting 3D components using a 3D printer and CAD as 
                well as to clear up any clutter in my workspace. The base plates were standard 42 by 42mm. These were created and then 
                printed using my personal printer. The housing for the components were however completed using Fusion 360. These parts had
                to be modelled using the constaints of size and considerations were made on the perfect fit. These fiels were then optimised 
                for 3D printing to reduce time, filament usage and most importantly cost. This project taught me design for manufacture and optimising prints
                for cost, time and print quality. This project also enhanced my CAD skills as I was making the moulds for the items I was priting.

            <h3>Self-Hosted Website</h3>
            <p>
                The current website that you are currently visiting is being self hosted by myself and a server. If you have already researched
                self hosting or know a thing or two about it. You would potentially know about the signficant risk associated with exposing your 
                home internet to the malicious attackers and bots. To prevent this I have routed my network traffic through cloudflare's tunnels to 
                prevent any malicious onlookers. The website was coded using HTML and CSS. The source code can be found on my github page 
                found in the contacts section. This project taught me how to set up SSH and the intricacies of the Internet. It also taught me how building things
                with a security first mindset is vital to prevent any malicious attackers.

            <h3>Solar Sunray</h3>
            <p>
                A solar-powered car was created using four panels: two small and two large. Electrical optimisations were implemented to ensure the car could operate under
                all environmental conditions experienced on Earth, including sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather. In total, eight switches were installed to control the series
                and parallel configurations of the panels, allowing the electrical system to be optimised for varying conditions. Gear-switching technology was also developed; 
                however, due to time constraints, this system could not be implemented in the final design. This was one of my first projects that I did in university in a team environment
                and it gave me great insight on how to contribute in a team with different ideas.
