    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate Mechatronic engineering student with extensive experience in CAD and
            mechanical fabrication. Notable projects include the designing and manufacturing of chemically
            powered vehicles (ChemECar and Solar Sunray Car). Through these projects I have gained
            proficiency in SolidWorks, Finite Element Analysis, C programming as well as 3D manufacturing and
            fabrication. I am also honoured to have been awarded the Long Tan ADF future innovator award for
            my projects and excellency in STEM. I combine a deep theoretical understanding of mechanical and
            electrical systems with hands-on experience in 3D printing as seen in my portfolio of projects.

            <h3>ChemECar</h3>
            <p>
                Using Solidworks 3D models were constructed for a fully 
                functioning chemically powered car. The final competition will be held in China.

                Using cloud-flare's tunnel security optimisations have been made.

            <h3>Solar Sunray</h3>
            <p>
                A Solar powered car was created using 4 panneles. 2 small and 2 large. Electical optimisations 
                were made such that the car could operate in all conditions experienced on Earth. i.e Sunny, 
                cloudy, rainy etc. In total 8 switches were implemented to control the parralel, series configurations
                of the car to optimise th eelectircal system of the car. Gear switching technology was also developed 
                however due to time constraints this system could not be implemented on time.
